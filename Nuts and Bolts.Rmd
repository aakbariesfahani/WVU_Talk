# What Data Science is Not

* Machine Learning applications
* Statistical Modeling
* Statistics or Computer Science
* Fancy word for people that make bunch of money
* The sexiest job

---

# What you need to succeed

> **Passion and Drive**

---

# Getting the foot in the door

* No one will hire you out of college as a data scientist
* You don't know anything

**The only way you will be successful is to accept these two facts**

* You have **to do** an internship
* You need a public present on LinkedIn
* You need to share personal or school projects
* You need to be on Stackoverflow
* You have to learn Git and GitHub
* Participate on Kaggle, but not for winning or fame

# Why you shouldn't become one

* It is really hard work
* It is not sexy, it is a lot of dirty work that you will struggle with
* Pay to work hours is horrible
* Your passion is Data|Machine Learning|AI or Statistics
